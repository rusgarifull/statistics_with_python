# ## Confidence intervals in python
# In this assessment, you will look at data from a study on toddler sleep habits. 
# 
# The confidence intervals you create and the questions you answer in this Jupyter notebook will be used to answer questions in the following graded assignment.

# Your goal is to analyse data which is the result of a study that examined
# differences in a number of sleep variables between napping and non-napping toddlers. Some of these
# sleep variables included: Bedtime (lights-off time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Onset Time (in
# decimalized time), Wake Time (sleep end time in decimalized time), Night Sleep Duration (interval
# between sleep onset and sleep end in minutes), and Total 24-Hour Sleep Duration (in minutes). Note:
# [Decimalized time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time) is the representation of the time of day using units which are decimally related.   
# 
# 
# The 20 study participants were healthy, normally developing toddlers with no sleep or behavioral
# problems. These children were categorized as napping or non-napping based upon parental report of
# childrenâ€™s habitual sleep patterns. Researchers then verified napping status with data from actigraphy (a
# non-invasive method of monitoring human rest/activity cycles by wearing of a sensor on the wrist) and
# sleep diaries during the 5 days before the study assessments were made.
# 
# 
# You are specifically interested in the results for Bedtime.

# Import the data
df = pd.read_csv("nap_no_nap.csv")

# First, look at the DataFrame to get a sense of the data
df


# In[5]:


df.napping.value_counts(0)


# **Question**: What value is used in the column 'napping' to indicate a toddler takes a nap? (see reference article)  
# **Question**: What is the overall sample size $n$? What is the sample size for toddlers who nap, $n_1$, and toddlers who don't nap, $n_2$?

# ### Average bedtime confidence interval for napping and non napping toddlers
# Create two 95% confidence intervals for the average bedtime, one for toddler who nap and one for toddlers who don't.

# First, isolate the column 'night bedtime' for those who nap into a new variable, and those who didn't nap into another new variable. 

# In[6]:


bedtime_nap = df[df.napping==1]['night bedtime']


# In[7]:


bedtime_no_nap = df[df.napping==0]['night bedtime']


# Now find the sample mean bedtime for nap and no_nap.

# In[8]:


nap_mean_bedtime = bedtime_nap.mean()


# In[9]:


no_nap_mean_bedtime = bedtime_no_nap.mean()


# In[10]:


print(nap_mean_bedtime,no_nap_mean_bedtime)


# Now find the sample standard deviation for $X_{nap}$ and $X_{no\ nap}$.

# In[11]:


# The np.std function can be used to find the standard deviation. The
# ddof parameter must be set to 1 to get the sample standard deviation.
# If it is not, you will be using the population standard deviation which
# is not the correct estimator
nap_s_bedtime = np.std(bedtime_nap, ddof=1)


# In[12]:


no_nap_s_bedtime = np.std(bedtime_no_nap, ddof=1)


# In[13]:


print(nap_s_bedtime, no_nap_s_bedtime)


# Now find the standard error for $\bar{X}_{nap}$ and $\bar{X}_{no\ nap}$.

# In[14]:


nap_se_mean_bedtime = nap_s_bedtime/np.sqrt(bedtime_nap.shape[0])


# In[15]:


no_nap_se_mean_bedtime = no_nap_s_bedtime/np.sqrt(bedtime_no_nap.shape[0])


# **Question**: Given our sample sizes of $n_1$ and $n_2$ for napping and non napping toddlers respectively, how many degrees of freedom ($df$) are there for the associated $t$ distributions?

# To build a 95% confidence interval, what is the value of t\*?  You can find this value using the percent point function (PPF): 
# ```
# from scipy.stats import t
# 
# t.ppf(probability, df)
# ```
# This will return the quantile value such that to the left of this value, the tail probabiliy is equal to the input probabiliy (for the specified degrees of freedom). 

# Example: to find the $t^*$ for a 90% confidence interval, we want $t^*$ such that 90% of the density of the $t$ distribution lies between $-t^*$ and $t^*$.
# 
# Or in other words if $X \sim t(df)$:
# 
# P($-t^*$ < X < $t^*$) = .90
# 
# Which, because the $t$ distribution is symmetric, is equivalent to finding $t^*$ such that:  
# 
# P(X < $t^*$) = .95
# 
# (0.95 = 1 - (1 - confidence) / 2 = 1 - 0.1 / 2 = 1 - 0.05)
# 
# So the $t^*$ for a 90% confidence interval, and lets say df=10, will be:
# 
# t_star = t.ppf(.95, df=10)
# 

# In[16]:


from scipy.stats import t


# In[17]:


# Find the t_stars for the 95% confidence intervals
nap_t_star = t.ppf(0.975, 14)


# In[18]:


no_nap_t_star = t.ppf(0.975, 4)


# In[19]:


print(nap_t_star, no_nap_t_star)


# **Quesion**: What is $t^*$ for nap and no nap?

# Now to create our confidence intervals. For the average bedtime for nap and no nap, find the upper and lower bounds for the respective 95% confidence intervals.

# **Question**: What are the 95% confidence intervals for the average bedtime for toddlers who nap and for toddlers who don't nap? 
# 
# CI = $\bar{X} \pm \ t^* \cdot s.e.(\bar{X})$

# In[22]:


ucl_no_nap = no_nap_mean_bedtime + no_nap_t_star * no_nap_se_mean_bedtime
